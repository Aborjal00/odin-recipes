    <p>Easy to make and a healthy alternative for lunch. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) zucchini</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound mild Italian pork sausage</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>6 ounces shredded low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped mixed fresh tender herbs, such as flat-leaf parsley and basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 13-x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cut zucchini in half lengthwise; cut off and discard stem ends. Using a spoon, scoop and scrape out pulp from center of each zucchini half, creating a 1/2-inch-thick shell. Measure out 3/4 cup zucchini pulp, and discard or reserve remaining pulp for another use. Arrange zucchini halves, cut side up, in prepared baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with Italian seasoning, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add Italian sausage; cook, stirring and breaking up with a spatula, until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion, garlic, crushed red pepper, the 3/4 cup zucchini pulp, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Stir in marinara, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer, undisturbed, until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1/2 cup pork mixture into each zucchini half; sprinkle evenly with mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until zucchini is tender and cheese is melted and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle evenly with herbs; serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
